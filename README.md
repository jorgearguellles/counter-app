## Test characteristics

- Easy to write
- Easy to understand
- Reliable
- Fast

## AAA Principles

1. **A of Arrange:** Step when we setup the initial state
    - Variables initialization
    - Imports required
2. **A of Act:** Step when we applied acts to stimulate the studied subject
    - Methods calls
    - Clicks simulations
    - Perform actions on the previous step
3. **A of Assert:** Step when we observe the resulting behavior
    - Verify if the result are the expected result
